# IPL 2022 Data Analysis Project

This repository contains my first data science mini-project, where I explore and analyze IPL 2022 cricket match data.

As a beginner in data science, my goal is to practice data analysis and data visualization using Python libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

This project marks my **first step** toward becoming a data analyst and data scientist!
